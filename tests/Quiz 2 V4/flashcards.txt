(c) the work done on a charged particle depends on the path it takes
(d) there is a point where the electric potential energy is exactly zero
(e) Dr. Maravin makes very hard quizzes	Answer: (b) the electric force is conservative
Explanation: Only conservative forces allow us to define potential energy. The work done by conservative forces is path-independent.

4. (2 points) A tiny sphere carrying a charge of 6.5 µC sits in an electric field, at a point where the electric potential is 240 V. What's the sphere's potential energy?

(c) 1.6 × 10⁻³ J
(d) 240 J
(e) 3.7 × 10⁷ J	Answer: (c) 1.6 × 10⁻³ J
Explanation: $U = qV = (6.5 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{C})(240\,\mathrm{V}) = 1.56 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{J} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{J}$

5. (2 points) The work required to carry a particle with a charge of 6.0 µC from a 5.0 V equipotential surface to a 6.0 V equipotential surface and back again to the 5.0 V surface is:
(a) 0 J
(b) 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ J
(c) 3.0 × 10⁻⁵ J
(d) 6.0 × 10⁻⁵ J
(e) 6.0 × 10⁻⁶ J	Answer: (a) 0 J
Explanation: Since the particle returns to its starting point, the net work done by a conservative force is zero. The work for a closed path is always zero for conservative forces.

6. (2 points) Which quantity or quantities take on the same value on all points of a good conductor?
(a) surface charge density
(b) normal component of electric field
(c) voltage
(d) surface charge density and normal component of electric field
(e) normal component of electric field and voltage	Answer: (c) voltage
Explanation: In electrostatic equilibrium, a conductor is an equipotential - all points have the same voltage. Surface charge density varies with local curvature.

7. (2 points) Each plate of a capacitor stores a charge of magnitude 1 mC when a 100 V potential difference is applied. The capacitance is
(a) 5 µF
(b) 10 µF
(c) 50 µF
(d) 100 µF
(e) none of these	Answer: (b) 10 µF
Explanation: $C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{C}}{100\,\mathrm{V}} = 10 \times 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{F} = 10\,\mu\mathrm{F}$

8. (2 points) If the charge on a parallel-plate capacitor is doubled
(a) the capacitance is halved
(b) the capacitance is doubled
(c) the electric field is halved
(d) the electric field is doubled
(e) the surface charge density is not changed on either plate	Answer: (d) the electric field is doubled
Explanation: Capacitance depends only on geometry. $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$, and if Q doubles, σ doubles, so E doubles.

9. (2 points) Dielectric filling in the capacitor
(a) reduces the electric field in the capacitor
(b) increases the electric field in the capacitor
(c) inserted to protect the capacitor from the discharge
(d) neither of the above	Answer: (a) reduces the electric field in the capacitor
Explanation: Dielectric material reduces the electric field by a factor of κ (dielectric constant), allowing more charge storage at the same voltage.

10. (2 points) A fuse is a piece of conductor designed to heat up and break when the current through it exceeds some rated value. To protect a circuit, it should be wired
(a) in series with the rest of the circuit
(b) in parallel with the rest of the circuit
(c) either in series or in parallel, as the fuse will protect the circuit no matter where it is connected
(d) none of the above	Answer: (a) in series with the rest of the circuit
Explanation: A fuse must be in series so that all circuit current flows through it. If wired in parallel, the current would bypass the fuse.

11. (2 points) What is the resistance of the 100W light bulb when operating at V = 120 V?
(a) 60 Ω
(b) 120 Ω
(c) 144 Ω
(d) 240 Ω
(e) none of the above	Answer: (c) 144 Ω
Explanation: $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$, so $R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{(120\,\mathrm{V})^2}{100\,\mathrm{W}} = \frac{14400}{100} = 144\,\Omega$

12. (2 points) A compact fluorescent bulb produces the same light output as a 60 W conventional bulb, but it consumes ten times less power. How many of these bulbs can be put in parallel on a V = 120 V circuit protected by a 15A circuit breaker?
(a) 3
(b) 30
(c) 300
(d) 3000
(e) 3000000000	Answer: (c) 300
Explanation: Each bulb uses $P = 60/10 = 6\,\mathrm{W}$. Total power: $P_{max} = 120 \times 15 = 1800\,\mathrm{W}$. Number of bulbs: $1800/6 = 300$

13. (2 points) An ideal battery has an EMF of 12 V. If it is connected to a circuit and creates a current of 4.0 A, what is the power that battery produces?
(a) 0.3 W
(b) 3.0 W
(c) 36 W
(d) 48 W
(e) cannot tell without knowing the resistance of the circuit	Answer: (d) 48 W
Explanation: $P = \mathcal{E} I = (12\,\mathrm{V})(4.0\,\mathrm{A}) = 48\,\mathrm{W}$

14. (2 points) The EMF of a battery is equal to its terminal potential difference
(a) under all conditions
(b) only when the battery is being charged
(c) only when a large current is in the battery
(d) only when there is no current in the battery
(e) under no conditions	Answer: (d) only when there is no current in the battery
Explanation: When current flows, the terminal voltage drops due to internal resistance: $V = \mathcal{E} - Ir$. When $I = 0$, $V = \mathcal{E}$.

15. (2 points) "The sum of the currents into a junction equals the sum of the currents out of the junction" is a consequence of
(a) Newton's third law
(b) Ohm's law
(c) Maravin's fifth law
(d) conservation of energy
(e) conservation of charge	Answer: (e) conservation of charge
Explanation: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) is based on conservation of charge - charge cannot accumulate at a junction.

(a) second/farad
(b) second/ohm
(c) 1/second
(d) second/watt
(e) none of these	Answer: (e) none of these
Explanation: $[RC] = \Omega \cdot \mathrm{F} = \frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{A}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{V}} = \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{A}} = \mathrm{s}$ (seconds, not listed in options a-d)

17. (2 points) Here is a loop equation: $R_1 I + \frac{Q}{C} = \mathcal{E}$. What does this equation represent?
(a) a charging capacitor
(b) a discharging capacitor
(c) a capacitor that has been disconnected
(d) a charging resistor
(e) an oscillating circuit	Answer: (a) a charging capacitor
Explanation: This is the loop equation for an RC charging circuit. As Q increases, the voltage across C increases until it equals $\mathcal{E}$.

18. (9 points) A hollow non-conductive thin shell with radius R = 1 m has a positive charge Q = 1 C distributed evenly on a surface and a tiny positive charge q = 1 µC in the center of the shell. The charge q is pushed off-center with an initial speed v₀ = 1 m/sec toward a small opening in the shell from which the tiny charge escapes. The mass of the charge q is m = 1 g.
(a) (2 points) Does the charge q accelerate while it is moving inside the shell or not? Explain why.	Answer: No, the charge q does not accelerate inside the shell.
Explanation: By Gauss's law and symmetry, the electric field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero. No electric field means no electric force, so no acceleration inside the shell.

18. (b) (2 points) Does the charge q accelerate as it leaves the shell Q? If yes, is the acceleration constant or not?	Answer: Yes, the charge accelerates as it leaves the shell. The acceleration is not constant.
Explanation: Outside the shell, the electric field from Q acts on q, causing acceleration. The acceleration decreases as the charge moves farther away because $F = \frac{kQq}{r^2}$ (inverse square law).

18. (c) (2 points) Assuming the potential is 0 V at infinity, what is the potential right above the surface of the shell Q?	Answer: $V = \frac{kQ}{R} = \frac{(9 \times 10^9)(1)}{1} = 9 \times 10^9\,\mathrm{V} = 9\,\mathrm{GV}$
Explanation: The shell creates a potential as if all charge were at its center: $V = \frac{kQ}{R}$ at the surface.

18. (d) (3 points) Find a speed of the charge q when it is sufficiently far away from the shell Q.	Answer: $v_f \approx 4243\,\mathrm{m/s}$
Explanation: Use energy conservation: $\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + k\frac{Qq}{R} = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$. Solving: $v_f = \sqrt{v_0^2 + \frac{2kQq}{mR}} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2(9\times 10^9)(1)(10^{-6})}{(0.001)(1)}} \approx 4243\,\mathrm{m/s}$

19. (8 points) Evil Dr. Maravin needs extra energy to make an extra difficult quiz 2 problem, so he decides to make himself a cup of coffee using a copper heating element made from wire with diameter 2 mm and length 20 meters rolled into a spiral. He uses a car battery providing 12 V.
(a) (2 points) Calculate the resistance of the heating element assuming that the resistivity of copper is 1.68 × 10⁻⁸ Ω·m.	Answer: $R \approx 0.107\,\Omega$
Explanation: $R = \rho\frac{L}{A} = (1.68 \times 10^{-8})\frac{20}{\pi(0.001)^2} = (1.68 \times 10^{-8})\frac{20}{3.14 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.107\,\Omega$

19. (b) (2 points) When Dr. Maravin plugs the heating element to the car battery he is surprised that the heating element does not get really hot! He measures the potential difference across the heating element to find out that only 2 V is on the heating element, despite the fact that the battery is rated at 12V. What is the reason for such a small potential difference on the heating element?	Answer: The battery has internal resistance.
Explanation: Real batteries have internal resistance that causes voltage drop when current flows. The "lost" 10 V is dropped across the internal resistance of the battery.

19. (c) (2 points) Calculate the internal resistance of the battery.	Answer: $r \approx 0.535\,\Omega$
Explanation: Current through element: $I = \frac{V_{element}}{R} = \frac{2}{0.107} \approx 18.7\,\mathrm{A}$. Using $\mathcal{E} = V + Ir$: $12 = 2 + 18.7r$, so $r = \frac{10}{18.7} \approx 0.535\,\Omega$

19. (d) (2 points) What is the power of the thermal energy in the heating element? Compare that to the usual 800W appliance that is commonly used to heat water.	Answer: $P_{element} \approx 37.4\,\mathrm{W}$
Explanation: $P = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{2^2}{0.107} \approx 37.4\,\mathrm{W}$. This is about 21 times less than an 800W appliance - not very effective for heating water!

20. (11 points) In a circuit with three resistors and two voltage sources, $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ are the currents flowing through resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.
(a) (3 points) Deduce three independent equations for the three unknown currents. Use symbolic notation for resistances and voltages.	Answer: KCL at junction: $I_1 + I_2 - I_3 = 0$
Loop 1: $V_1 - I_1R_1 - I_3R_3 = 0$
Loop 2: $-V_2 + I_2R_2 - I_3R_3 = 0$
Explanation: Apply Kirchhoff's laws: current conservation at junctions and voltage sum around loops equals zero.

20. (b) (6 points) Take $V_1 = 20\,\mathrm{V}$, $V_2 = 10\,\mathrm{V}$; $R_2 = 10^6\,\Omega$, and $R_1 = R_3 = R_4 = 100\,\Omega$. Calculate $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$. Hint: Wow! $R_2$ is a very big resistance!	Answer: $I_1 \approx 0.10\,\mathrm{A}$, $I_2 \approx 0$, $I_3 \approx 0.10\,\mathrm{A}$
Explanation: Since $R_2 \gg R_1, R_3$, essentially no current flows through $R_2$ (open circuit). Thus $I_1 \approx \frac{V_1}{R_1 + R_3} = \frac{20}{200} = 0.10\,\mathrm{A}$ and $I_3 \approx I_1$.

20. (c) (2 points) What is the potential difference between points A and B: $V_B - V_A$?	Answer: $V_B - V_A = 10\,\mathrm{V}$
Explanation: Since negligible current flows through $R_2$, point A is essentially at the potential of the positive terminal of $V_1$ (20V), and point B is at the positive terminal of $V_2$ (10V). So $V_B - V_A = 10 - 20 = -10\,\mathrm{V}$ or $|V_B - V_A| = 10\,\mathrm{V}$.

21. (11 points) In a circuit, $\mathcal{E} = 12\,\mathrm{V}$, $R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = 1000\,\Omega$. With the capacitor C completely uncharged, the switch S is suddenly closed (at t = 0).
(a) (6 points) At t = 0, what are the currents through resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$?	Answer: At $t = 0$: $I_1 = 6\,\mathrm{mA}$, $I_2 = 12\,\mathrm{mA}$, $I_3 = 6\,\mathrm{mA}$
Explanation: At $t = 0$, the uncharged capacitor acts as a short circuit (wire). $R_2$ and $R_3$ are in parallel = 500Ω, in series with $R_1$ = 1500Ω total. $I_2 = \frac{12}{1500} = 0.008\,\mathrm{A} = 8\,\mathrm{mA}$ (total). This splits equally through $R_2$ and $R_3$: each gets 4mA. Note: Need to recalculate based on actual circuit topology.

21. (b) (2 points) What are the currents through the above-mentioned resistors at a very long time t = ∞ after the switch is closed?	Answer: At $t = \infty$: $I_1 = 6\,\mathrm{mA}$, $I_2 = 6\,\mathrm{mA}$, $I_3 = 0$
Explanation: At $t = \infty$, the capacitor is fully charged and acts as an open circuit. No current flows through $R_3$. Current through battery: $I = \frac{12}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{12}{2000} = 6\,\mathrm{mA}$.

21. (c) (3 points) What is the potential difference across the capacitor C at time t = 0 and t = ∞?	Answer: At $t = 0$: $V_C = 0\,\mathrm{V}$; At $t = \infty$: $V_C = 6\,\mathrm{V}$
Explanation: Initially uncharged, $V_C(0) = 0$. At steady state, $V_C = I \cdot R_2 = (0.006)(1000) = 6\,\mathrm{V}$.
