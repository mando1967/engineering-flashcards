(c) either in series or in parallel, as the fuse will protect the circuit no matter where it is connected
(d) none of the above	Answer: (a) in series with the rest of the circuit
Explanation: A fuse must be in series so that all circuit current flows through it. If wired in parallel, the current would bypass the fuse.

(b) 30
(c) 300
(d) 3000
