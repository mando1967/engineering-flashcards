One morning you find yourself marooned on an uninhabited island with a
box of 3V batteries, about fifty of the 100 Ω resistors, and a box of twenty
1 𝛍F capacitors. To construct a signaling device you need to make the
following items from some of the parts available to you. Draw a clear
diagram of the following:

Question 19 11.5 / 14 pts

Being isolated in the middle of the pandemic with nothing to do, you
decide to do your own EP2 experiments to impress your lab instructor.
You start by using a 9V battery, some nice copper wires of negligible
resistance, and two 12 inch flat copper pan lids you "borrowed" from your
roommate to serve as plates for your makeshift parallel plate capacitor.
You also have a nice multimeter that you intend to use as an ammeter for
your experiments.

Experiment 1: you set the lids to be separated by about 0.5 inch from
each other and connect to the battery with an ammeter to measure the
current.  

(a) (2 points) Draw the circuit of the "capacitor", battery, and ammeter.

(b) (2 points) As soon as you complete the circuit, the current is maximal
and you measured it to be 1 A. What's the internal resistance of the
battery?

(c) (2 points) What's the capacitance of your capacitor?

(d) (2 points) How much energy is stored in this capacitor?

After the capacitor is fully charged, you disconnect the battery. Now you
increase the separation of the capacitor's plates to about 1 inch.

(f) (2 points) How much energy is stored in this capacitor?

(g) (2 points) And how much work did you do to separate the plates?
