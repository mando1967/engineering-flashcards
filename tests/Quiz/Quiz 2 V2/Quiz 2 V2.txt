Work alone and answer all questions. Part I questions must be answered on the Scantron cards. Put
your name on your card. Color in the correct box completely for every answer with a pencil. If you
make a mistake, erase thoroughly. Don’t forget to color in the boxes for your WID. If we
have to correct this by hand we may take off five points from your score! Part II must be
answered in the space provided on the test. The last page is a detachable equation sheet. You may
use a calculator. You may ask the proctors questions of clarification. Show your work in a clear and
organized manner. You may receive partial credit for partial solutions. Solutions lacking supporting
calculations will receive no points.

(52 points total)

17. (14 points) An alpha particle (two protons and two neutrons) moves into a stationary gold nucleus
(79 protons and 118 neutrons), as shown in Figure above. The alpha particle momentarily stops
when its center is at radial distance r = 9.23 · 10−15 m from the nuclear center. Then it moves
back along its incoming path. Because the gold nucleus is much more massive than the alpha
particle, we can assume the gold nucleus does not move.

(a) (2 points) What are charges of alpha particle and gold nucleus?

(b) (4 points) Find the electric potential of the nucleus at the distance r, where the alpha particle
comes to a stop. Assume the nucleus to be charged uniformly. If you take any assumptions,

(d) (4 points) Use the formula that you derived in (b) written in symbolic form to calculate the
magnitude of the electric field at distance r ( |Er| = | − ∂V/∂r|). How does it compare with
electric field of the gold nucleus, treated as a single point-like charge?
