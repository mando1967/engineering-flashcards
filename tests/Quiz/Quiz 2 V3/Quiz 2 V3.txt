Work alone and answer all questions. Part I questions must be answered on the Scantron cards. Put
your name on your card. Color in the correct box completely for every answer with a pencil. If you
make a mistake, erase thoroughly. Don’t forget to color in the boxes for your WID. If we
have to correct this by hand we may take off five points from your score! Part II must be
answered in the space provided on the test. The last page is a detachable equation sheet. You may
use a calculator. You may ask the proctors questions of clarification. Show your work in a clear and
organized manner. You may receive partial credit for partial solutions. Solutions lacking supporting
calculations will receive no points.

1000 Ω resistors, and a box of forty 1 µF capacitors. Draw clear diagrams to indicate how you
would connect parts together to make the following (you need not use all the available parts):

the surface of the sphere?

(c) (4 points) What is the capacitance of this sphere?

(d) (4 points) How much of energy is stored in this sphere? (Hint: A single sphere can be

17. (16 points) Call I1, I2, and I3 the current flowing through the resistors labeled R1, R2, and R3,
respectively. To help the graders out, use the directions of the currents shown in the figure.

(c) (4 points) Do the same thing for the case R1 = R3 = 1000 Ω and R2 = 1 Ω, with the voltages

18. (12 points) The figure above shows the circuit of a flashing lamp, like those attached to barrels
at highway construction sites. The fluorescent lamp L (of negligible capacitance) is connected in
parallel across the capacitor C of the RC circuit. There is a current through the lamp only when
the potential difference across it reaches the breakdown voltage VL; then the capacitor discharges
completely through the lamp and the lamp flashes briefly.

(a) (4 points) For a lamp with breakdown voltage VL = 62 V wired to a 100 V ideal battery, and
a 0.25 µF capacitor what resistance R is needed for the flashes to happen twice per second?

(b) (4 points) How much of energy will be delivered to the fluorescent lamp in each flash (assume
all the energy of the capacitor will go to the lamp).

(c) (4 points) Estimate how long does it take for the capacitor to almost fully discharge through
the lamp, if the lamp resistance is about 100 Ω?
