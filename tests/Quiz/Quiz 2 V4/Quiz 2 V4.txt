(39 points total) 

18. (9 points) A hollow non-conductive thin shell with radius R = 1 m, pictured above, has a positive 
charge Q = I C distributed evenly on a surface and a tiny positive charge q = I µC in the center 
of the shell. The charge q is pushed off-center with an initial speed v0 = I m/sec toward a small 
opening in the shell from which the tiny charge escapes. The m8$S of the charge q ism= 1 g, 
and you should assume that the charge Q is fixed in space and cannot move. Assume that the 
opening does not affect the symmetry of the charge distribution on the shell (a ssume shell to have 
a perfectly uniform charge distribution on its surface in your calculations).

19. (8 points) Evil Dr. Maravin needs extra energy to make an extra difficult quiz 2 problem, so he 
decides to make himself a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, he does not have a water heater in his 
office, so he decides to make an improvised heating element from a spool of copper wire with a 
diameter of 2 mm and a length of 20 meters that he rolled into a spiral. For a power source, he 
uses a car battery of his colleague who made a mistake of leaving his car keys on Dr. Maravin's

terminals.

that the heating elements does not get really hot! Annoyed, he measures the potential differ-
ence across the heating element to find out that only 2 V is on the heating element, despite 
the fact that the battery is rated at 12V. What is the reason for such a small potential 
difference on the heating element? (Hint: the car battery is not ideal.0
