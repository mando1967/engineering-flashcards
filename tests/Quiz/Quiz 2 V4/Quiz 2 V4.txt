(39 points total) 
18. (9 points) A hollow non-conductive thin shell with radius R = 1 m, pictured above, has a positive 
charge Q = I C distributed evenly on a surface and a tiny positive charge q = I µC in the center 
of the shell. The charge q is pushed off-center with an initial speed v0 = I m/sec toward a small 
opening in the shell from which the tiny charge escapes. The m8$S of the charge q ism= 1 g, 
and you should assume that the charge Q is fixed in space and cannot move. Assume that the 
opening does not affect the symmetry of the charge distribution on the shell ( assume shell to have 
a perfectly uniform charge distribution on its surface in your calculations). 
(a) (2 points) Does the charge q accelerate while it is moving inside the shell or not? Explain

R..-~ t S.q 19. (8 points) Evil Dr. Maravin needs extra energy to make an extra difficult quiz 2 problem, so he 
decides to make himself a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, he does not have a water heater in his 
office , so he decides to make an improvised heating element from a spool of copper wire with a 
diameter of 2 mm and a length of 20 meters that he rolled into a spiral. For a power source, he 
uses a car battery of his colleague who made a mistake of leaving his car keys on Dr. Maravin's 
desk. The battery is in a good condition and provides 12 V of potential difference across the 
terminals. 
(a) (2 points) Calculate the resis ance of the heating element assuming that the resistivity of 
copper is 1.68 X 10-S S1 · m.

f- (b) (2 pomts) When Dr. Mara in plugs the heating element to the car battery he is surprised :.--- J 
that the heating elements does not get really hot! Annoyed, he measures the potential differ-
ence across the heating element to find out that only 2 V is on the heating element, despite 
the fact that the battery is rated at 12V. What is the reason for such a small potential 
difference on the heating element? (Hint: the car battery is not ideal.0
