      "question": "An electron has charge −e and mass $m_e$. A proton has charge e and mass $1840m_e$. A \"proton volt\" equals:",
      "choices": [
        "(a) 1 eV",
        "(b) 1840 eV",
        "(c) $1/\\sqrt{1840}$ eV",

        "(e) 1/1840 eV"
      ],
      "answer": "(a) 1 eV",
      "explanation": "An electron volt (eV) is the energy gained by a particle with charge magnitude e moving through 1 V potential difference. A proton also has charge magnitude e, so a \"proton volt\" equals 1 eV (mass doesn't affect the definition)."
