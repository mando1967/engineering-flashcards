      "question": "When one says that a capacitor C has a charge Q that means that the actual charges on its plates are:",
      "choices": [
        "(a) Q, Q",
        "(b) Q/2, -Q/2",
        "(c) Q, -Q",
        "(d) Q/2, Q/2",
        "(e) Q, 0"
      ],
      "answer": "(c) Q, -Q",
      "explanation": "A capacitor stores equal and opposite charges on its two plates. When we say a capacitor has charge Q, one plate has +Q and the other has -Q, maintaining overall charge neutrality while creating an electric field between the plates.",

      "question": "If you increase the distance between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor connected to a battery, you will:",
      "choices": [
        "(a) increase the capacitance",
        "(b) increase the potential difference",
        "(c) not affect the potential difference",
        "(d) decrease the potential difference",
        "(e) make Prof. Maravin cry"
      ],
      "answer": "(c) not affect the potential difference",
      "explanation": "When connected to a battery, the potential difference across the capacitor remains constant (equal to the battery voltage). However, increasing the distance decreases capacitance (C = ε₀A/d), which reduces the charge stored (Q = CV). The battery maintains constant voltage.",

        "(e) none of these"
      ],
      "answer": "(e) none of these",
      "explanation": "For identical capacitors in series, the voltage divides equally. With 100V across the combination, each capacitor gets a fraction of this voltage. The charge Q = CV depends on the specific circuit configuration. Without seeing the exact circuit diagram, we need to analyze the series/parallel arrangement to determine the actual charge.",

      "choices": [
        "(a) the charge on C₁",

        "(e) none of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "(b) the sum of the charges on C₁ and C₂",
      "explanation": "In parallel, capacitors share the same voltage but store different charges. The equivalent capacitance is C_eq = C₁ + C₂, so Q_eq = C_eq × V = (C₁ + C₂) × V = C₁V + C₂V = Q₁ + Q₂. Total charge is conserved.",

        "(d) charge",
        "(e) force"
      ],
      "answer": "(d) charge",
      "explanation": "Ampere-hours (Ah) = current × time = charge. This rating tells you how much total charge the battery can deliver. For example, a 50 Ah battery can theoretically deliver 50 A for 1 hour, or 1 A for 50 hours. Since Q = I × t, Ah is a unit of charge (1 Ah = 3600 C).",

        "(e) the current through the area"
      ],
      "answer": "(e) the current through the area",
      "explanation": "Current density J has units of A/m². When integrated over an area: I = ∫J⃗·dA⃗, we get total current (in amperes) flowing through that surface. This is analogous to electric flux Φ = ∫E⃗·dA⃗, but for current instead of electric field.",

        "(f) None of the above"
      ],
      "answer": "(d) 4R",
      "explanation": "Resistance R = ρL/A. If length doubles (L → 2L) and volume V = LA stays constant, then area must halve (A → A/2). New resistance: R_new = ρ(2L)/(A/2) = 4ρL/A = 4R. Both length increase and area decrease contribute to quadrupling the resistance.",

      "answer": "(b) II",
      "explanation": "Ohm's law states V = IR, which means current is directly proportional to voltage. The graph should be a straight line through the origin with positive slope (I vs V or V vs I). Graph II shows this linear relationship characteristic of ohmic materials.",

        "(f) conservation of energy"
      ],
      "answer": "(f) conservation of energy",
      "explanation": "Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) is based on conservation of energy. As you traverse a closed loop, the total energy change must be zero - energy gained from batteries equals energy lost across resistors. This ensures no net energy change after completing a loop.",

      "answer": "(a) 8 A, down",
      "explanation": "Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum leaving. By analyzing the junction and applying KCL (conservation of charge), we can determine the missing current must be 8 A flowing downward to balance the currents.",

      "answer": "(b) 6 Ohms",
      "explanation": "Total power P = V²/R_eq = 48 W with V = 12 V gives R_eq = 144/48 = 3 Ω. For two identical resistors in parallel: R_eq = R/2, so R = 2 × 3 = 6 Ω. Alternatively, each bulb gets 24 W, so R = V²/P = 144/24 = 6 Ω.",

      "explanation": "Bulb brightness depends on power dissipated (P = I²R = V²/R). The dimmest bulbs receive the least current or voltage. Circuit IV likely has the highest total resistance or lowest current through each bulb, resulting in the dimmest illumination.
