TO REVIEW IMAGES:
1. Open flashcards.txt
2. Check each [IMAGE:...] tag matches the question content
3. If images need to be reordered or changed, edit the [IMAGE:...] tags in flashcards.txt
4. Images are located in: c:\inetpub\wwwroot\quizwiz\tests\Quiz 2 V5\images\

NOTES:
- Questions 13-16 likely all reference the same circuit diagram
- You may want to consolidate to use the same image for Q13-16 if they show the same circuit
- Check if the images match the question topics described above
