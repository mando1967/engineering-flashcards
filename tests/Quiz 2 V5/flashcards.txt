1. (3 points) An electron has charge −e and mass $m_e$. A proton has charge e and mass $1840m_e$. A "proton volt" equals:
(a) 1 eV
(b) 1840 eV
(c) $1/\sqrt{1840}$ eV
(d) $\sqrt{1840}$ eV
(e) 1/1840 eV	Answer: (a) 1 eV
Explanation: An electron volt (eV) is the energy gained by a particle with charge magnitude e moving through 1 V potential difference. A proton also has charge magnitude e, so a "proton volt" equals 1 eV (mass doesn't affect the definition).

2. (3 points) The fact that we can define electric potential energy means that:
(a) the electric force is conservative
(b) there is a point where the electric potential energy is exactly zero
(c) it takes work for the electric force to move from some point a to some other point b and back again
(d) the electric force is nonconservative
(e) the work done on a charged particle depends on the path it takes	Answer: (a) the electric force is conservative
Explanation: Only conservative forces allow us to define potential energy. For conservative forces, work is path-independent and the work around a closed loop is zero.

9. (3 points) A wire with a length of 150 m and a radius of 0.15 mm carries a current with a uniform current density of $2.8 \times 10^7$ A/m². The current is:
(a) 300 A
(b) 5.9 A
(c) 0.63 A
(d) 26000 A
(e) 2.0 A	Answer: (e) 2.0 A
Explanation: $I = J \cdot A$ where $A = \pi r^2 = \pi(1.5 \times 10^{-4})^2 \approx 7.07 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{m}^2$. Thus $I = (2.8 \times 10^7)(7.07 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 1.98 \approx 2.0\,\mathrm{A}$

10. (3 points) Five cylindrical wires are made of the same material. Their lengths and radii are given. [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V5-1.png]
Rank the wires according to their resistances, least to greatest.
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
(b) 1 and 2 tie, then 5, 3, 4

(d) 1, 3, 4, 2, 5
(e) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5	Answer: Need image data to determine correct answer
Explanation: For cylindrical wires, $R = \rho \frac{L}{A} = \rho \frac{L}{\pi r^2}$. Resistance is proportional to length L and inversely proportional to $r^2$. Calculate $L/r^2$ for each wire to rank them.

11. (3 points) Lightbulb A, a 60W model, and lightbulb B, a 40W model, are connected in parallel across a 120V power supply. Which statement below is false
(a) The voltage difference across lightbulb B is 120V
(b) More current flows through the battery than through lightbulb B
(c) Lightbulb B has a higher resistance than lightbulb A
(d) Less current flows through lightbulb A than lightbulb B	Answer: (d) Less current flows through lightbulb A than lightbulb B
Explanation: $I = P/V$. $I_A = 60/120 = 0.50\,\mathrm{A}$, $I_B = 40/120 = 0.33\,\mathrm{A}$. More current flows through A than B, so (d) is false.

12. (3 points) The internal resistance in a real battery causes what to happen when the battery is connected to a resistive "load"? (Pick the best answer)
(a) The voltage across the battery terminals decreases when the battery is connected to low resistance loads.
(b) The battery warms when connected to low resistance loads.
(c) The current supplied by the battery falls to less than the nominal battery voltage divided by the load resistance
(d) All of the above	Answer: (d) All of the above

(a) (3 points) Make a $2500\,\Omega$ resistor	Answer: Use two $1000\,\Omega$ in series ($2000\,\Omega$), then add two $1000\,\Omega$ in parallel ($500\,\Omega$), then connect these in series: $2000 + 500 = 2500\,\Omega$
Explanation: Series resistors add: $R_{series} = R_1 + R_2$. Parallel: $\frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$

17. (b) (3 points) Make a $0.25\,\mu\mathrm{F}$ capacitor [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V5-4.png]	Answer: Connect four $1\,\mu\mathrm{F}$ capacitors in series
Explanation: For series capacitors: $\frac{1}{C_{series}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + \frac{1}{C_4} = \frac{4}{1} = 4$, so $C_{series} = 0.25\,\mu\mathrm{F}$

Explanation: The potential from the ring: $V = \frac{kQ}{r} = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0\sqrt{R^2 + h^2}}$

18. (b) (5 points) Find the electrical force acting on a small particle at point P carrying charge q and mass m in the vertical (z) direction. Hint: $E_z = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}$	Answer: $F_z = qE_z = -q\frac{\partial V}{\partial z} = \frac{Qqh}{4\pi\epsilon_0(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}$
Explanation: Take derivative of V with respect to h (or z): $\frac{\partial V}{\partial h} = -\frac{Qh}{4\pi\epsilon_0(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}$, so $E_z = \frac{Qh}{4\pi\epsilon_0(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}$ and $F_z = qE_z$

18. (c) (5 points) Determine the radius R that would make the total force acting on this particle vanish. Assume $g = 9.8\,\mathrm{m/s}^2$, and the direction of the gravitational field is downward. Assume $Qq > 0$.	Answer: $R = \sqrt{\frac{Qq}{4\pi\epsilon_0 mg} - h^2}$
Explanation: For equilibrium: $F_{electric} = F_{gravity}$. $\frac{Qqh}{4\pi\epsilon_0(R^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} = mg$. Solve for R: $R^2 + h^2 = \left(\frac{Qqh}{4\pi\epsilon_0 mg}\right)^{2/3}$

19. (14 points) Call $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ the current flowing through resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.
(a) (8 points) Deduce three independent equations for three unknown currents. Use symbolic values for resistances and voltages.	Answer: 
KCL: $I_1 + I_2 - I_3 = 0$
Loop 1: $\mathcal{E}_1 - I_1R_1 - I_3R_3 = 0$
Loop 2: $-\mathcal{E}_2 + I_2R_2 - I_3R_3 = 0$
Explanation: Apply Kirchhoff's laws: current conservation at junctions and voltage sum around closed loops equals zero.

19. (b) (3 points) Take $\mathcal{E}_1 = 6\,\mathrm{V}$, $\mathcal{E}_2 = 12\,\mathrm{V}$, $R_1 = R_3 = 1000\,\Omega$, $R_2 = 1\,\Omega$. Solve for the currents. Hint: Wow, $R_2$ is small; what is the voltage difference across $R_3$?	Answer: $I_1 \approx 0$, $I_2 \approx 12\,\mathrm{A}$, $I_3 \approx 12\,\mathrm{A}$
Explanation: Since $R_2 \ll R_3$, nearly all voltage from $\mathcal{E}_2$ appears across $R_3$. Thus $I_3 \approx 12/1000 = 0.012\,\mathrm{A} = 12\,\mathrm{mA}$. Actually, $I_2$ dominates through small $R_2$.

19. (c) (3 points) Do the same for $R_2 = 10^6\,\Omega$, with other components the same. Hint: this is a very big resistance!	Answer: $I_1 \approx 3\,\mathrm{mA}$, $I_2 \approx 0$, $I_3 \approx 3\,\mathrm{mA}$
Explanation: Since $R_2 \gg R_1, R_3$, essentially no current flows through $R_2$. The voltage difference across $R_3$: $V_3 = \mathcal{E}_2 - \mathcal{E}_1 = 6\,\mathrm{V}$. $I_3 = I_1 = 6/2000 = 3\,\mathrm{mA}$

20. (12 points) The graph shows voltage across a 0.1 F capacitor and across the series combination of capacitor and resistor.

Explanation: The time constant $\tau = RC$ is the time for exponential to reach $1-1/e \approx 63\%$ (charging) or $1/e \approx 37\%$ (discharging).

20. (b) (2 points) What is the resistance of the circuit?	Answer: $R = \frac{\tau}{C}$ where $\tau$ is from part (a) and $C = 0.1\,\mathrm{F}$

Explanation: Use exponential decay: $V(t) = V_{max} e^{-t/\tau}$. Solve for time t when voltage drops to 0.8 V.

20. (e) (2 points) How much current is flowing into the capacitor at t = +1.5 s? Hint: $\frac{dQ}{dt} = I$	Answer: $I = C\frac{dV}{dt}$ evaluated at $t = 1.5\,\mathrm{s}$
Explanation: Current is the rate of charge change. For a capacitor, $I = C\frac{dV}{dt}$. Find the slope of the voltage curve at t = 1.5 s from the graph and multiply by C.
