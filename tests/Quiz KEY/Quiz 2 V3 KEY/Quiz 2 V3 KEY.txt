Work alone and answer all questions. Part I questions must be answered on the Scantron cards. Put 
your name on your card. Color in the correct box completely for every answer with a pencil. If you 
make a mistake, erase thoroughly. Don't forget to color in the boxes for your WID. If we 
have to correct this by hand we may take off five points from your score! Part II must be 
answered in the space provided on the test. The last page is a detachable equation sheet. You may 
use a calculator. You may ask the proctors questions of clarification. Show your work in a clear and 
organized manner. You may receive partial credit for partial solutions. Solutions lacking supporting 
calculations will receive no points.
