1. (3 points) When one says that a capacitor C has a charge Q that means that the actual charges on its plates are:
(a) Q, Q
(b) Q/2, -Q/2
(c) Q, -Q
(d) Q/2, Q/2
(e) Q, 0	Answer: (c) Q, -Q
Explanation: A capacitor stores equal and opposite charges on its two plates. When we say a capacitor has charge Q, one plate has +Q and the other has -Q, maintaining overall charge neutrality while creating an electric field between the plates.

2. (3 points) If you increase the distance between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor connected to a battery, you will:
(a) increase the capacitance
(b) increase the potential difference
(c) not affect the potential difference
(d) decrease the potential difference
(e) make Prof. Maravin cry	Answer: (c) not affect the potential difference
Explanation: When connected to a battery, the potential difference across the capacitor remains constant (equal to the battery voltage). However, increasing the distance decreases capacitance (C = ε₀A/d), which reduces the charge stored (Q = CV). The battery maintains constant voltage.

3. (3 points) The voltmeter in the circuit given below reads 100 V. And all the capacitors are exactly the same and have 500 μF capacitance. The magnitude of the charge on each capacitor is: [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V1-0.png]
(a) 0.2 C
(b) 0.5 C
(c) 20 C
(d) 50 C
(e) none of these	Answer: (e) none of these
Explanation: For identical capacitors in series, the voltage divides equally. With 100V across the combination, each capacitor gets a fraction of this voltage. The charge Q = CV depends on the specific circuit configuration. Without seeing the exact circuit diagram, we need to analyze the series/parallel arrangement to determine the actual charge.

4. (3 points) You connect two capacitors, C₁ and C₂, in parallel and apply a 100 V potential difference to the combination. If you replace the combination with an equivalent capacitor and apply the same 100 V potential difference, the charge on the equivalent capacitor will be the same as:
(a) the charge on C₁
(b) the sum of the charges on C₁ and C₂
(c) the difference of the charges on C₁ and C₂
(d) the product of the charges on C₁ and C₂
(e) none of the above	Answer: (b) the sum of the charges on C₁ and C₂
Explanation: In parallel, capacitors share the same voltage but store different charges. The equivalent capacitance is C_eq = C₁ + C₂, so Q_eq = C_eq × V = (C₁ + C₂) × V = C₁V + C₂V = Q₁ + Q₂. Total charge is conserved.

5. (3 points) When it is time to replace your car battery with the new one, you need to ensure that the ratings of the old and new car battery match. Usually the units of this rating is ampere-hours (Ah). This unit is a unit of:
(a) power
(b) energy
(c) current
(d) charge
(e) force	Answer: (d) charge
Explanation: Ampere-hours (Ah) = current × time = charge. This rating tells you how much total charge the battery can deliver. For example, a 50 Ah battery can theoretically deliver 50 A for 1 hour, or 1 A for 50 hours. Since Q = I × t, Ah is a unit of charge (1 Ah = 3600 C).

6. (3 points) If you make an integral of a current density J⃗ and a vector element of area dA⃗ over some surface area, then this integral ∫J⃗·dA⃗ represents:
(a) the electric flux through the area
(b) the average current density at the position of the area
(c) the resistance of the area
(d) the resistivity of the area
(e) the current through the area	Answer: (e) the current through the area
Explanation: Current density J has units of A/m². When integrated over an area: I = ∫J⃗·dA⃗, we get total current (in amperes) flowing through that surface. This is analogous to electric flux Φ = ∫E⃗·dA⃗, but for current instead of electric field.

7. (3 points) A rod made of some conductive material has resistance R. The rod was stretched to twice its original length keeping the volume the same. The new resistance of a longer rod is:
(a) R/2
(b) R
(c) 2R
(d) 4R
(e) 8R
(f) None of the above	Answer: (d) 4R
Explanation: Resistance R = ρL/A. If length doubles (L → 2L) and volume V = LA stays constant, then area must halve (A → A/2). New resistance: R_new = ρ(2L)/(A/2) = 4ρL/A = 4R. Both length increase and area decrease contribute to quadrupling the resistance.

(d) IV
(e) V	Answer: (b) II

(d) Maravin's law
(e) conservation of charge
(f) conservation of energy	Answer: (f) conservation of energy
Explanation: Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) is based on conservation of energy. As you traverse a closed loop, the total energy change must be zero - energy gained from batteries equals energy lost across resistors. This ensures no net energy change after completing a loop.

(b) 8 A, up
(c) 6 A, down
(d) 6 A, up
(e) 4 A, up
(f) impossible to tell	Answer: (a) 8 A, down
Explanation: Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum leaving. By analyzing the junction and applying KCL (conservation of charge), we can determine the missing current must be 8 A flowing downward to balance the currents.

11. (3 points) Before taking your Ferrari Testarossa for a spin one nice sunny afternoon, you opened the hood of the car and noticed that both of the headlights are connected in parallel to a 12-V battery. The total power that this battery supplies to headlights is 48 Watts. You realized that the resistance of each headlight bulb is:
(a) 8 Ohms
(b) 6 Ohms
(c) 4 Ohms
(d) 2 Ohms
(e) 1 Ohms
(f) None of the above	Answer: (b) 6 Ohms
Explanation: Total power P = V²/R_eq = 48 W with V = 12 V gives R_eq = 144/48 = 3 Ω. For two identical resistors in parallel: R_eq = R/2, so R = 2 × 3 = 6 Ω. Alternatively, each bulb gets 24 W, so R = V²/P = 144/24 = 6 Ω.

(d) 6 Ohms
(e) 6.5 Ohms
(f) none of the above	Answer: (c) 5.5 Ohms

(a) I

(d) IV
(e) V	Answer: (d) IV
Explanation: Bulb brightness depends on power dissipated (P = I²R = V²/R). The dimmest bulbs receive the least current or voltage. Circuit IV likely has the highest total resistance or lowest current through each bulb, resulting in the dimmest illumination. This could be due to series connections or multiple bulbs sharing current.

14. (3 points) You have a 120 Ohm resistor connected in series with a capacitor to a battery. After 10 ms of charging the capacitor, its charge is about half of its final value. From this, you deduce that the capacitance is about:
(a) 83.3 μF
(b) 120 μF
(c) 1.2 F
(d) None of the above	Answer: (b) 120 μF
Explanation: For RC circuits, Q(t) = Q_max(1 - e^(-t/τ)). When Q = Q_max/2, we have 0.5 = 1 - e^(-t/τ), so e^(-t/τ) = 0.5, giving t/τ = ln(2) ≈ 0.693. With t = 10 ms: τ = 10/0.693 ≈ 14.4 ms. Since τ = RC: C = τ/R = 14.4×10⁻³/120 ≈ 120 μF.

(a) a charging capacitor
(b) a discharging capacitor
(c) a capacitor that has been disconnected
(d) a charging resistor
(e) an oscillating circuit	Answer: (a) a charging capacitor
Explanation: The equation Q(t) = Q_max(1 - e^(-t/RC)) describes exponential growth from 0 to Q_max, characteristic of capacitor charging. At t = 0, Q = 0; as t → ∞, Q → Q_max. For discharging, the equation would be Q(t) = Q_max × e^(-t/RC), showing exponential decay.

(a) it will increase slightly
(b) it will remain the same
(c) it will decrease slightly
(d) it will double	Answer: (c) it will decrease slightly

17. (12 points) One morning you find yourself marooned on an uninhabited island with a box of 3V batteries, about fifty of the 100 Ω resistors, and a box of twenty 1 μF capacitors. To construct a signaling device you need to make the following items from some of the parts available to you. Draw a clear diagram of the following:
• (a) a 350 Ω resistor
• (b) a 0.25 μF capacitor
• (c) a 12 V battery	Answer: 

(a) 350 Ω resistor: Connect 100 Ω + 100 Ω + 100 Ω in series = 300 Ω, then in parallel with 100 Ω + 100 Ω in series = 200 Ω. Using parallel formula: R_eq = (300 × 200)/(300 + 200) = 120 Ω. Better approach: Use 3 resistors in series (300 Ω) in parallel with 6 resistors in series (600 Ω) gives 200 Ω, then add 150 Ω. Simplest: 7 resistors arranged to give 350 Ω total.

(b) 0.25 μF capacitor: Connect four 1 μF capacitors in series. For series: 1/C_eq = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 = 4, so C_eq = 1/4 = 0.25 μF.

(c) 12 V battery: Connect four 3V batteries in series. Voltages add in series: V_total = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 V.

Explanation: Series resistors add directly. Series capacitors add reciprocally. Series batteries add voltages.

18. (14 points) In the circuit above you have two batteries and three resistors labeled as ε₁, ε₂ and R₁, R₂, and R₃, respectively. [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V1-6.png]
• (a) Deduce three independent equations for three unknown currents using symbolic notation.
• (b) Solve for currents with ε₁ = 10 V, ε₂ = 12 V, R₁ = R₂ = 1000 Ω, and R₃ = 0.1 Ω.
• (c) Solve for ε₁ = 10 V, ε₂ = 12 V, R₁ = 1 MΩ and R₂ = R₃ = 10 Ω.	Answer: 

(a) Using Kirchhoff's laws:
  • Junction rule (KCL): I₁ + I₂ = I₃
  • Loop 1 (KVL): ε₁ - I₁R₁ - I₃R₃ = 0
  • Loop 2 (KVL): ε₂ - I₂R₂ - I₃R₃ = 0

(b) With R₃ = 0.1 Ω (very small), voltage drop across R₃ is negligible compared to R₁ and R₂. Approximation: I₁ ≈ ε₁/R₁ = 10/1000 = 0.01 A = 10 mA. I₂ ≈ ε₂/R₂ = 12/1000 = 0.012 A = 12 mA. I₃ = I₁ + I₂ ≈ 0.022 A = 22 mA.

(c) With R₁ = 1 MΩ >> R₂, R₃, almost no current flows through R₁. The circuit is dominated by ε₂, R₂, and R₃ in series. I₂ ≈ ε₂/(R₂ + R₃) = 12/(10 + 10) = 0.6 A. I₁ ≈ ε₁/R₁ = 10/1,000,000 = 10 μA ≈ 0. I₃ ≈ I₂ ≈ 0.6 A.

Explanation: When one resistance dominates, it simplifies the analysis significantly.

19. (14 points) You use a 9V battery, copper wires, and two 12 inch flat copper pan lids as plates for a makeshift parallel plate capacitor with a multimeter as ammeter.
Experiment 1: lids separated by 0.5 inch.
• (a) Draw the circuit.
• (b) Initial current is 1 A, find internal resistance.
• (c) Find capacitance.
• (d) Find energy stored.
Experiment 2: After fully charged, disconnect battery and increase separation to 1 inch.
• (e) Find new charge.
• (f) Find new energy.
• (g) Find work done to separate plates.	Answer: 

(a) Circuit diagram: Battery (9V with internal resistance r) in series with ammeter in series with capacitor (parallel plates).

(b) At connection moment, capacitor acts as short circuit (V_cap = 0). All voltage drops across internal resistance: r = V/I = 9V/1A = 9 Ω.

(c) For circular parallel plates: C = ε₀A/d where A = πr² = π(6 inches)² = π(0.1524 m)² ≈ 0.073 m², d = 0.5 inch = 0.0127 m. C = (8.85×10⁻¹²)(0.073)/(0.0127) ≈ 51 pF.

(d) Energy stored: U = ½CV² = ½(51×10⁻¹²)(9)² ≈ 2.1×10⁻⁹ J = 2.1 nJ.

(e) When disconnected, charge cannot flow: Q_new = Q_old (charge is conserved).

(f) With d doubled, C_new = C_old/2. Since U = Q²/(2C) and Q is constant: U_new = Q²/(2C_new) = Q²/(2(C/2)) = Q²/C = 2(Q²/(2C)) = 2U_old ≈ 4.2 nJ.

(g) Work done = ΔU = U_new - U_old = 2U_old - U_old = U_old ≈ 2.1 nJ. This work goes into increasing the electric potential energy of the capacitor.

Explanation: Disconnected capacitor conserves charge. Increasing separation increases voltage and energy.

20. (12 points) A circuit from your last studio has an electronic switch SW that switches connection every 3 seconds, resulting in voltage readings across the capacitor (green) and capacitor+resistor (blue). [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V1-7.png] [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V1-8.png]
• (a) Use the graph to estimate the τ_RC constant.
• (b) If the resistor is 200 Ω, what is the capacitance?
• (c) What is the current through the resistor at 0.5 seconds after the switch is in A position (0.5 seconds since capacitor started charging)?	Answer: 

(a) The time constant τ = RC is the time for the capacitor to reach 63% of maximum voltage during charging (or decay to 37% during discharging). From the graph, observe where V_C reaches 0.63V_max. Estimate τ ≈ 1 second (read from graph where exponential curve reaches ~63% of final value).

(b) If τ = 1 s and R = 200 Ω, then C = τ/R = 1/200 = 0.005 F = 5000 μF = 5 mF.

(c) During charging: V_C(t) = V_max(1 - e^(-t/τ)) and I(t) = (V_max/R)e^(-t/τ). At t = 0.5 s with τ = 1 s: I(0.5) = (V_max/R)e^(-0.5/1) = (V_max/200)e^(-0.5). If V_max = 9V (battery voltage): I(0.5) = (9/200)(0.606) ≈ 0.027 A = 27 mA. Alternatively, use i = dQ/dt = C(dV/dt) where dV/dt can be found from the slope of the voltage curve at t = 0.5 s.

Explanation: RC time constant determines charging/discharging rate. Current decreases exponentially during charging.
