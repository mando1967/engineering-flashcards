7. (3 points) Lightbulb A, a 60W model, and lightbulb B, a 40W model, are connected in parallel across a 120V power supply. Which statement below is false

10. (3 points) A capacitor is being discharged through a resistance 10 Ω. In about 10 seconds, the voltage on the capacitor changed from 10 V to about 3.3 V. What is the capacitance of the capacitor? [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V3-2.png]
(a) 1 pF
(b) 1 nF
(c) 1 µF
(d) 1 mF
(e) 1 F	Answer: Decay law: $V = V_0 e^{-t/RC}$. At $t=10\,\mathrm{s}$, $V/V_0 = 0.33$. So $e^{-10/RC} = 0.33 \Rightarrow RC \approx 9.0\,\mathrm{s}$. With $R = 10\,\Omega$, $C \approx 0.9\,\mathrm{F}$. Closest choice: (e).
