# Problem #1 — Moment of Each Force About A (Using Trig Notation)

**Given:**  
Two men exert forces on ropes attached to a vertical pole.  
- Force **F = 80 lb** acts at a point **6 ft** below the top of the pole.  
- Force **P = 50 lb** acts at the top of the pole.  
- The pole height from ground to the top is **18 ft**.  
- The line of action for **P** is at **45°** above the horizontal (to the left).  
- The line of action for **F** follows a **3–4–5** triangle (down-right direction).

We are asked to determine the **moment of each force about point A** (the base of the pole) and the **direction of rotation** (clockwise or counterclockwise).

## Step 1: Geometry and Distances

- Point of application of **P** is at the top of the pole → perpendicular distance = 18 ft.  
- Point of application of **F** is 6 ft below the top → height = 12 ft above A.

## Step 2: Moment of Force P About A

Moment magnitude is:

M<sub>P</sub> = (vertical distance from A) × (horizontal component of P)

The horizontal component of **P** is:

P<sub>x</sub> = P·cos(45°) = 50·cos(45°) = 50·(√2 / 2)

Since this horizontal component pulls the pole top **to the left**, it tends to rotate the pole **counterclockwise** about A.

Therefore,

M<sub>P</sub> = 18·P·cos(45°)  
M<sub>P</sub> = 18·(50)·(√2 / 2)  
M<sub>P</sub> = 450√2 ≈ **636.4 ft·lb (counterclockwise)**

## Step 3: Moment of Force F About A

The horizontal component of **F** is:

F<sub>x</sub> = F·(4/5) = 80·(4/5) = 64 lb

The perpendicular (vertical) distance from A to the line of action is 12 ft.

Moment magnitude:

M<sub>F</sub> = 12·F<sub>x</sub> = 12·(80·4/5) = 12·64 = **768 ft·lb**

This force pulls the pole **to the right**, producing a **clockwise** moment.

---

## Step 4: Determine Direction of Rotation

- M<sub>P</sub> = 636.4 ft·lb (counterclockwise)
- M<sub>F</sub> = 768 ft·lb (clockwise)

Since M<sub>F</sub> > M<sub>P</sub>, the **net rotation** of the pole about A will be **clockwise**.

## ✅ Final Answers

| Force | Moment Expression | Moment (ft·lb) | Direction |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| P = 50 lb | 18·P·cos(45°) | 636.4 | CCW |
| F = 80 lb | 12·F·(4/5) | 768 | CW |

**Result:** Pole rotates **clockwise** about point A.
