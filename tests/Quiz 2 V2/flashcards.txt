3. (3 points) To protect the circuit, how would you connect the fuse?
(a) in series with the circuit in question
(b) in parallel with the circuit in question
(c) fuse does not have to be connected to the circuit, just placing it in the vicinity is sufficient	Answer: (a) in series with the circuit in question
Explanation: Fuses must be in series so all current flows through them. When current exceeds the rating, the fuse melts and breaks the circuit, preventing damage.

4. (3 points) If 1000 J of work is required to carry 25 C charge from one point to another, the potential difference between these two points is
(a) 25,000 V
(b) 40 V

(d) depends on the path
(e) none of these	Answer: (b) 40 V, since V = W/q = 1000 J / 25 C
Explanation: Voltage (potential difference) is work per unit charge: V = W/q. It's path-independent in electrostatics. 1 Volt = 1 Joule/Coulomb.

(e) 120 C	Answer: (c) 1800 C, since Q = I t = 0.5 A × 3600 s
Explanation: Current is charge flow rate: I = Q/t, so Q = I×t. Remember to convert time to seconds (1 hour = 3600 s). 1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/second.

6. (3 points) The figure below shows a junction. What is true of the currents? (a) i1 = i0 + i2 (b) i2 = i0 + i1 [IMAGE:images/Quiz 2 V2-2.png]
(c) i0 = i1 − i2 (e) i0 = i2 − i1 Answer: (d) i1 = i0 − i2 (KCL: i0 = i1 + i2 ⇒ i1 = i0 − i2)
Explanation: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL): The sum of currents entering a junction equals the sum leaving. Charge is conserved - what flows in must flow out.

7. (3 points) For a cylindrical resistor that obeys Ohm's Law the resistance does NOT depend on:
(a) the current
(b) the length
(c) the cross-sectional area

8. (3 points) Pulling the plates of an isolated charged capacitor apart:
