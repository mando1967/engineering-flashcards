### Issue Resolved: Image Mapper Display Bug

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Problem 18 referenced `Quiz 2 V3-5.png` which doesn't exist in the file system
- Only images 0-4 exist (Quiz 2 V3-0.jpg through Quiz 2 V3-4.png)
- The image-mapper correctly parsed the IMAGE tag but `includes()` returned false because the referenced image wasn't in the available images array
- This caused no image to appear as selected in the UI

**Debugging Process:**
- Added comprehensive console logging to image-mapper.html
- Discovered that mappings array contained "Quiz 2 V3-5.png" but available images only had 0-4
- Confirmed file system only has 5 images, not 6

### Changes Made ✅

#### Quiz 2 V3 Flashcards - Problem Numbering Fixed
**Issue:** Problems 16, 17, 18 were incorrect/out of order
- **Problem 16**: Was showing circuit problem with I1, I2, I3 - INCORRECT
- **Problem 17**: Was showing neon lamp problem (not in original quiz) - INCORRECT  
- **Problem 18**: Referenced missing image V3-5.png - INCORRECT

**Fixed:**
- **Problem 16**: Now correctly shows charged conducting sphere (16 points, no image)
- **Problem 17**: Now correctly shows circuit with I1, I2, I3 currents (16 points, IMAGE: V3-3.png)
- **Problem 18**: Now uses existing image V3-4.png instead of missing V3-5.png
- Removed incorrect Problem 17 (neon lamp - not in original Quiz 2 V3)

#### image-mapper.html Updates
- Updated Quiz 2 V3 image count from 6 to 5 (line 308)
- Added enhanced debugging for Problem 18 (lines 214-228, 354-365)
- Debug logs show problem number, index, filenames, and includes() results

#### index.html - Cache-Busting Added
- Added `?t=${Date.now()}` to all flashcards.txt fetch requests (lines 564, 776, 790)
- Prevents browser/server caching issues when flashcard files are updated
- Ensures users always get the latest version

### Final Image Mapping for Quiz 2 V3
- Problem 8: Quiz 2 V3-1.png
- Problems 10-14: Quiz 2 V3-2.png (shared circuit)
- Problem 17: Quiz 2 V3-3.png (circuit with I1, I2, I3)
- Problem 18: Quiz 2 V3-4.png (flashing lamp)
- Problem 16: No image (charged sphere)

### Verification ✅
- Image mapper displays all 18 problems correctly
- All images show proper selections
- index.html displays correct problems and images
- All three browsers confirmed working after cache-busting implementation
